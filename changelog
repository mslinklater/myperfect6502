# Changelog

* Optimised bitmap clear - it's sparse array so just un-set the flags that were set the last go around rather than memset the entire memory block to zero
* Moved to STL containers for data structures rather than raw pointer memory blocks
* Added command line parameters for ROM loading etc
* Moved to C++
* Moved to CMake instead of Make
